CS210 Class Project
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project entailed a request from a client in which we had to write a new program. This program was geared to High School students in an effort to teach them "fiscal responsibility". [I can say as an a Chicago Public School student, that was a first generation American this course would have been extremely beneficial.] The main idea is to demonstrate the fiscal opportunity in investments by demostrating their ROI.  
•	What did you do particularly well?
This was my second project in my third class. We didn't have a skeleton/base to work with and had to start from scratch. This is difficult because you have to rely on your knowledge, but also a lot of double checking and cross referencing. Writing this program from scratch was a strength. I could add more comments to why I do something. I am not a CS major, and because of that, a lot of times I'm winging it and changing stuff on the fly. Just trying what "works" and this doesn't help when trying to add comments for me and fellow programmers. 
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I didn't have have any parts of my code to be "private". If I would have made certain variables private it would have improved the security level of the program. 
•	Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I heavily relied on my textbook, stackexchance, and YouTube to get to the point I needed. 
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills in this project are more valuable than anything else. Reading a program and possibly bulding one from scratch will be essential in the future (like upcoming/imminent). In a liberal arts course I took, we discussed how AI is being developed and will overtake most jobs. This will happen. It is inevitable. But, that AI will need some help/progamming hand when it comes to certains topics that are difficult to comprehend, such as the liberal arts. Which is why it is important to know as much as possible.  
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to follow the programmers code/ethics as close as possible. Given my lack of expertise and practice, it wasn't prefect. But, it was neat.
